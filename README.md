# Myth Game is highly inspired by Smol Ame by KevinCow https://kevincow.itch.io/smol-ame

## What is this game about?
This game is about Smol Ame and Smol Gura playing a game.
Gura tries to hit Ame with her single shot but randomly generated bullet speed gun.
Ame's mission is simple: Dodge every bullet she can.

## How to play?
You can use 'WASD' or ´arrow keys´

* W and Up arrow key is jump
* A and Left arrow key is move left
* D and Right arrow key is move right
* S and Down arrow key does nothing yet

## Known bugs and etc.
* If you were pressing a key while Gura hits you, I suggest you to refresh the page because it detects you're still pressing that key. 
If you press that key again, it should go back to normal.

* Bgm won't stop if you pause.

* Bgm isn't replaying.

* If you die or press ´retry´ game will instantly start.
